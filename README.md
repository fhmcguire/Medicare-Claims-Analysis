The purpose of this repository is to explore working with simulated Medicare claims data available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS): https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/medicare-claims-synthetic-public-use-files

"Medicare Claims Synthetic Public Use Files (SynPUFs) were created to allow interested parties to gain familiarity using Medicare claims data while protecting beneficiary privacy.  The data structure of the Medicare SynPUFs is very similar to the CMS Limited Data Sets, but with a smaller number of variables.  They provide data analysts and software developers the opportunity to develop programs and products utilizing the identical formats and variable names as those which appear in the actual CMS data files.  The files have been designed so that programs and procedures created on the SynPUFs will function on CMS Limited Data Sets. The SynPUFs also provide a robust set of metadata on the CMS claims data that have not been available in the public domain.  After developmental work has been completed potential users should be much better informed about which CMS data products they would need to acquire to fulfill their analytic needs."

I am also using this repository to build my skills using Python for data management and analysis.
